<i><u><b>(1.)Java2_Login_Hib</b></u></i> : Example of login in java using hibernate framework.<br> Here main roles are ADMIN and STUDENT. When you have to give rights to profile, for example admin can see student details as well as edit and delete too , but in student profile they only can view it. So Login is required to check who logged in student/admin ? Logic behind this example -> when student or admin enters a login detail then servlet will fetch list of login credentials from database and if username password matches then it will redirect to dashboard page otherwise redirects to login page and sends message to retry again. <br>
<i><u><b>(2.)Java2_Reg_Hib</b></u> </i>: Example of Students to register on jsp page and insert data to database table.[above login hibernate application is modified with registration module] <br>
